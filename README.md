# whole-house-audio
FOSS linux based whole house audio system. 

The goal of this system is to allow for Airplay devices to send audio to a central managment system which distributes the audio to both local soundcards, a DLNA receiver and (to a lesser extent) chromecast audio receivers. Configuration of local Spotify and Plex media players which allow for remote control of content through their apps is also included.

The intent of this repository is to co-locate all configuration files needed to configure the various components of the system. These components include:
- [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast)
- [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync)
