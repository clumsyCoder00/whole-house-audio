# whole-house-audio
FOSS linux based whole house audio system. 

The goal of this system is to allow for Airplay devices to send audio to a central managment system which distributes the audio to both local soundcards, a DLNA receiver and (to a lesser extent) chromecast audio receivers. Configuration of local Spotify and Plex media players which allow for remote control of the local player through their mobile app is also included.
This system is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 on AND64 hardware. A cursory revew found all packages (with the exeception of pulseaudio-dlna) to also be available for ARM systems although this is not tested.
The intent of this repository is to co-locate all configuration files needed to configure the various components of the system. These components include:
- [Snapcast](https://github.com/badaix/snapcast) - a multiroom client-server audio player
- [shairport-sync](https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync) - an AirPlay audio player
- ALSA - the software framework of the Linux kernel which manages sound card device drivers
- LADSPA - an API that allows for effects plugins to be applied to soundcards and other sound destinations in the Linux OS.
- [LADSPA-DSP](https://github.com/bmc0/dsp) - used to implement acoutic room correction impulse files generated by [RoomEQWizard](https://www.roomeqwizard.com/) via the LADSPA API
- [LSP (Linux Studio Plugins)](https://github.com/sadko4u/lsp-plugins) - used to implement [equal loudness curves](https://lsp-plug.in/?page=manuals&section=loud_comp_stereo) via the LADSPA API
- [pulseaudio-dlna](https://github.com/masmu/pulseaudio-dlna) - for sending audio to LDNA clients. I appear to be using the [noarhch package](https://opensuse.pkgs.org/tumbleweed/packman-x86_64/pulseaudio-dlna-0.6.0+git20190209.b0db813-1.4.noarch.rpm.html) because there is no build canidate of the main package for Ubuntu 18.04. [This guide](https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/10/how-to-use-pulseaudio-dlna-to-stream.html) may be of some assistance as well.
- [esphome](https://esphome.io/) - for control of power amplifier power supplies. ampControl script polls for active sound cards, sends ON signal to ESP8266 relay of amplifier(s) associated with active soundcard(s).
